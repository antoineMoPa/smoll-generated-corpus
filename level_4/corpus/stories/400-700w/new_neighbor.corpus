The first time Jake saw the new kid, he was sitting alone on the front steps of his house, staring at the sidewalk like it held all the answers to the universe. Jake slowed down as he pedaled his bike past, the warm afternoon sun making the dust swirl around his wheels. The kid looked small, his backpack slung low on his shoulders, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his faded jeans. Jake had lived on Maple Street for as long as he could remember, and no one ever just *showed up* like that—like they belonged there.

He stopped his bike a few feet away and leaned it against the fence. The new kid didn’t look up right away. “Hey,” Jake said, keeping his voice light. “You just move here?”

The kid finally glanced over, his dark eyes wide and a little unsure. “Yeah. My dad got a new job.” He shifted his weight, like he was trying to decide if he should say more.

Jake nodded. He knew what that felt like—like the whole world had shifted just because your dad came home with a different name tag on his shirt. “That’s rough,” Jake said. “My mom used to work at the grocery store, and then she got a job at the library, and everything changed.” He grinned. “But now I get to check out books I wouldn’t normally read.”

The kid’s mouth twitched, like he was trying not to smile. “Yeah, well, I don’t really like books.” He hesitated. “But I do like video games.”

Jake’s grin widened. “Me too. *Minecraft*? I’m pretty good at building stuff.” He gestured toward the kid’s backpack. “You got any controllers in there?”

The kid pulled out a small, worn game case. “This is all I got. My old stuff got left behind.” His voice dropped a little, like he was embarrassed.

Jake’s chest tightened. He knew how that felt too—like losing something important, even if it wasn’t your fault. “No worries,” he said. “I’ve got a few extra controllers at my house. You can borrow them.” He thought for a second. “Or, uh, you could just come over sometime. My brother’s really good at *Fortnite*, and he’s always looking for a teammate.”

The kid’s eyes lit up, just a little. “Yeah? That’d be cool.”

Jake stood up straight. “Tomorrow after school? My place is right there.” He pointed to a house two down. “Unless you’ve got something else going on.”

The kid shook his head. “Nope. That’d be great.”

Over the next few weeks, the new kid—whose name was Mateo—became a regular at Jake’s house. They played games, talked about school, and even went exploring behind the old train tracks behind their street. One afternoon, as they sat on the hill overlooking the neighborhood, Mateo sighed. “I still miss my old friends sometimes.”

Jake understood. He’d felt the same way when he first moved to Maple Street, even though it had been years ago. “It gets easier,” he said. “But it’s okay to miss them. What matters is that you’ve got people here now.” He nudged Mateo with his elbow. “And I’ve got your back in *Call of Duty*.”

Mateo laughed, but there was something serious in his eyes. “Thanks, Jake. For not being weird about me being new.”

Jake shrugged. “You’re not weird. You’re just… new.” He grinned. “And now you’re stuck with me.”

The lesson wasn’t just about making friends—it was about remembering what it felt like to be the new one. Sometimes, the smallest kindness could turn into something bigger, something that made the whole world feel a little less lonely. And that was worth more than any game or any house.
