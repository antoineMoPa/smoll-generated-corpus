Fish are aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a diverse group of vertebrates that inhabit nearly every body of water on Earth, from the deepest ocean trenches to high-altitude mountain streams. As the most species-rich group of vertebrates, fish outnumber all other vertebrate classes combined, with over thirty-four thousand described species. Their evolutionary history spans more than five hundred million years, making them the oldest known group of vertebrates. While the term fish is often used colloquially to describe any aquatic animal, in biological terms, it specifically excludes mammals like whales and dolphins, as well as invertebrates such as jellyfish and shellfish. The study of fish is known as ichthyology, a branch of zoology dedicated to understanding their biology, behavior, and ecological roles.

The significance of fish extends far beyond their sheer numbers. They are fundamental components of aquatic ecosystems, serving as both predators and prey within complex food webs. By consuming algae, plankton, and smaller organisms, fish help regulate population dynamics and maintain water quality. Conversely, they provide a critical food source for larger predators, including birds, marine mammals, and humans. Economically, fish are indispensable. They represent a primary source of protein for billions of people worldwide and support massive global industries ranging from commercial fishing and aquaculture to recreational angling and the aquarium trade. Culturally, fish have inspired mythology, art, and religion across civilizations, symbolizing everything from fertility and abundance to spiritual transformation.

Fundamentally, fish are defined by a set of shared anatomical and physiological characteristics adapted for life underwater. The most distinct feature is their method of respiration. Fish extract dissolved oxygen from water using gills, specialized organs composed of thin filaments that maximize surface area for gas exchange. As water flows over the gills, oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream while carbon dioxide is expelled. This process is highly efficient, allowing fish to thrive in environments where oxygen levels can fluctuate dramatically. Unlike terrestrial vertebrates that breathe air, most fish cannot survive out of water for extended periods because their gill structures collapse without the buoyancy of water, preventing effective oxygen uptake.

Locomotion in fish is achieved primarily through the undulation of their bodies and the use of fins. The skeleton, which may be made of bone in bony fish or cartilage in sharks and rays, provides structural support and anchor points for powerful muscles. These muscles contract in waves along the body, pushing against the water to generate forward thrust. Fins act as stabilizers, rudders, and brakes. The caudal fin, or tail, is the main propeller, while the pectoral and pelvic fins assist with steering, balancing, and hovering. Some species have evolved specialized fins for walking along the sea floor or even gliding above the water surface. To control their depth without constant swimming, many bony fish possess a swim bladder, an internal gas-filled organ that adjusts buoyancy. By regulating the amount of gas in this bladder, a fish can remain suspended at a specific depth with minimal energy expenditure.

Fish exhibit an extraordinary range of sizes, shapes, and colors, reflecting their adaptation to virtually every aquatic niche. At one end of the spectrum is the Paedocypris, a tiny carp species measuring less than a centimeter in length. At the other extreme is the whale shark, the largest fish in the world, which can grow up to eighteen meters and weighs as much as several elephants. Their body shapes are often dictated by their lifestyle. Fast-swimming pelagic predators like tuna and marlin have streamlined, torpedo-shaped bodies to reduce drag. In contrast, bottom-dwelling species like flounders and rays have flattened bodies that allow them to rest on the sediment or hide in crevices. Coloration serves various functions, including camouflage, communication, and warning signals. Some fish can change their color rapidly to blend with their surroundings or to signal aggression and readiness to mate.

Classification of fish is broadly divided into three main groups: jawless fish, cartilaginous fish, and bony fish. Jawless fish, represented today by hagfish and lampreys, are the most primitive lineage. They lack paired fins and true jaws, feeding by sucking fluids or scavenging. Cartilaginous fish, which include sharks, rays, and skates, have skeletons made of flexible cartilage rather than bone. This adaptation makes them lighter and more maneuverable in the water. They are often apex predators, playing a crucial role in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems by culling sick and weak prey. The vast majority of fish, however, belong to the group known as bony fish. This diverse assemblage includes familiar species like salmon, trout, bass, goldfish, and seahorses. Bony fish are characterized by their ossified skeletons and, in most cases, the presence of a swim bladder and protective scales.

Reproduction among fish is equally diverse. Most species are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs that develop outside the mother's body. In many cases, fertilization is external, with males and females releasing sperm and eggs into the water column simultaneously in events known as spawning. This strategy relies on producing vast numbers of eggs to ensure that at least a few offspring survive the dangers of predation and environmental hazards. Other species practice internal fertilization, where the male transfers sperm directly to the female. Some sharks and rays give birth to live young, nourishing them internally until they are fully developed. Parental care varies widely; while many fish abandon their eggs immediately after spawning, others, such as cichlids and seahorses, exhibit remarkable dedication, guarding their nests or carrying their young in specialized pouches.

Sensory perception in fish is highly developed and often includes abilities unknown to terrestrial animals. In addition to sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch, many fish possess a lateral line system. This network of sensory receptors runs along the sides of the body and detects minute changes in water pressure and vibration. It allows fish to sense the movement of nearby predators or prey, navigate in murky waters, and school together with precise coordination. Some species, like electric eels and knifefish, have evolved the ability to generate and detect electric fields for navigation, communication, and hunting in dark environments.

Despite their resilience and adaptability, fish face significant threats in the modern era. Overfishing has depleted populations of many commercially valuable species, disrupting food webs and altering ecosystem structures. Habitat destruction, caused by dam construction, dredging, and coastal development, fragments populations and eliminates critical breeding grounds. Pollution, including plastic waste, agricultural runoff, and industrial chemicals, degrades water quality and accumulates in fish tissues, posing risks to both the animals and the humans who consume them. Furthermore, climate change is warming ocean and freshwater temperatures, causing coral bleaching, shifting species distributions, and acidifying waters, which threatens the survival of species with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons.

Conservation efforts are increasingly vital to ensure the future of fish diversity. Sustainable fishing practices, the establishment of marine protected areas, and the restoration of degraded habitats are essential steps toward recovery. Aquaculture, when managed responsibly, offers a way to meet global food demands without further depleting wild stocks. Understanding the biology and ecology of fish is not merely an academic pursuit but a necessity for preserving the health of the planet's water systems. As sentinels of aquatic health, the status of fish populations often reflects the broader condition of the environment, making their protection integral to the well-being of all life on Earth.
